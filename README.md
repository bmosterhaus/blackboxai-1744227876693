# SiteMonitor - Website Monitoring Service

## Project Overview
SiteMonitor is a comprehensive website monitoring service designed to notify users of website downtimes or performance issues. With support for global monitoring and instant alerts, it helps users ensure their online presence is always available and performing optimally.

## Installation
To set up the SiteMonitor project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sitemonitor.git
   cd sitemonitor
   ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file in a web browser:**
   This project does not require a backend server for the front-end functionalities. You can directly open `index.html` in any web browser to view the application.

## Usage
Once the `index.html` file is open in the browser, you will be greeted with the homepage featuring:

- An overview of the features.
- A navigation bar for easy access to the dashboard and other sections.
- A call-to-action to investigate the service further.

You can navigate to the Dashboard to see a status summary of your monitored sites, as well as examples of monitor details.

## Features
- **Instant Alerts:** Get notified instantly on website downtimes via email, SMS, or push notifications.
- **Global Monitoring:** Monitor your website from multiple locations around the world.
- **Performance Reports:** Access detailed reports on uptime, response times, and other performance metrics.

## Dependencies
This project leverages the following libraries:
- **Tailwind CSS:** For utility-first CSS styling. Loaded via CDN.
- **Font Awesome:** For the iconic font library. Loaded via CDN.

No additional libraries or frameworks are required, although for a complete development setup, a local web server would be beneficial for handling future dynamic capabilities.
